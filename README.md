# Mental-Illness-tracker
AI-Driven Mental Health Analysis from Social Media

## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage AI and machine learning techniques to analyze social media posts and behavioral patterns for early detection and monitoring of mental health conditions. By assessing user sentiment and self-reported mental health data, the system provides insights into the impact of social media on mental well-being.

## Dataset

The project utilizes two datasets:

mentalHealth(socialMedia).csv: Contains user-generated content with labeled mental health indicators (e.g., anxiety, depression, stress levels).

mentalHealthBehaviour.csv: Includes respondent demographics, social media interaction frequency, self-reported mental health status, and impact scores.

## Key Features

Sentiment Classification: Detects distress levels from textual social media posts.

Mental Health Impact Analysis: Assesses the effect of social media usage on mental well-being.

Self-Reported Mental Health Prediction: Uses behavioral and demographic data to infer mental health status.
